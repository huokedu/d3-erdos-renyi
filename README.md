# Erdos-Renyi

A fun project to visualize a small Erdos-Renyi model using D3 visualization. Sliders are used to pick the number of nodes and the p value. The p is the probability that two edges are connected. The idea seems simple, but this model has been shown to be very accurate concerning certain types of networks and explains ideas such as the 6 degrees of separation.
